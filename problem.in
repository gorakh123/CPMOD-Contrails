PBE problem specification

1                              ! Problem choice

Problem choices (all with continuous PBE except option 7):
1. PSR with user inputs
2. Test case: aggregation with constant kernel
3. Test case: aggregation with Brownian kernel
4. Test case: aggregation-growth
5. Test case: nucleation-growth
6. Test case: uniform binary fragmentation
7. Test case: discrete PBE, aggregation with Brownian kernel
